Please remember all the we used to do used to do without him.
Please remember all the things we used to say used say without him. 
Please remember all the way we used to date used to date around him.
Please remember when we used to hang a round hand around for someone. 
I’m growing growing sick of this sick of this sick of this without her.
I’m growing a sick of this sick of it sick of it sick of it without her. 
I’m doing this I’m doing this I’m doing this doing this without her. 
I’m going in I’m going in I’m going in going in without her. 
Please remember all the things we used to do used to do with Adam.
Please remember all the things we used to say used to say with Adam.
Please remember all the days a useless useless useless Atom.
Please remember we were made we were made for someone. 
I’m growing sick sick of this stupid stupid stupid up n atom.
I’m growing a tired of it a stupid stupid stupid lookin’ Adam.
I’m fucking I’m fucking with a hoe hoe Susana.
For I’m growing tired of a Suzy Suzy Ana.
