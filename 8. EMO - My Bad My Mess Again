PG 2 Lyric

This emptiness my head no head.
This empty mess my bed my bad.
My bad, my bad, again, again. 
My head my head my head no head. 

Her lips i bit I bit.
Again, again, again, again. 
The bruise I left again again. 
I kissed her friend, her friend, her friend.

This emo head, my head not my head.
This emo mess my bad not my bad. 
Again again my bed my bed. 
Her blade her blade her razor blade. 

My wrist my wrist my wrist my wrist.
The pain the pain it give it gives.
It’s Chris it’s Chris it’s Christopher.
His pain his pain his pain his pain.

Again, again, again, again. 
The bruise I left again again. 
I kissed her friend, her friend, her friend.

This emo head, my head not my head.
This emo mess my bad not my bad. 
Again again my bed my bed. 

(Again again again. Again.) 
(Again again again. Again.) 
(Again again again. Again.)
