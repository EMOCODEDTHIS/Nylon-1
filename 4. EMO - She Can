PG 2 Lyric 

Take it take it take it away.
Shake it shake it shake it a way.
Break it break it break her all day.
Breakfast lunch and dinner my plate.

I like it when I’m with her all day.
I’m in love with her all always.
I cannot change change her ways.
Oh there goes her faith again.

Take it take it she can take it away.
When she shakes it & shakes it shakes it a way.
I’m break it break it I’m break her all day.
I cannot change her in anyway. 

I think about her all of the time.
I think about her all of the night.
I think I like her want her to be mine.
I think without her I’m a nothing at all.

Lady oh lady old lady.
With babies with babies with babies.
Go go go.

Walk home the way you do at noon.
Go home to the one you like to have at home.
Resting in the evening all all alone.
With the one that you like to have at a home.
